AI co-Physicist: run powerful physics tools to drive cutting edge research

## How it works

It is a command line tool (like Claude Code:)

It runs LLMs in a loop (ie it's a set of agents)

## Demo

To demonstrate we give it a goal

```
Figure out how to propulsively land on Mars
```

### Why?

This is a very hard problem as it involves real-time simulation of turbulent flow, this is an area of active scientific research by NASA, SpaceX and others.

### What we expect?

Agent should
